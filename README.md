# game-color
The simple game with HTML, CSS and JS.

The game consists of just clicking on the correct color (defined by the background color of the panel) and scoring points. 
For every right click, + 10 points, if you clicked wrong you lose.    ¯ \ _ (ツ) _ / ¯
 

But be happy! You can save your result in a local ranking.

I hosted the game on a free and very top platform, after taking a look:

The game is in an initial state so doubts, criticisms or suggestions are very welcome.


I went already!
